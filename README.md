# Edge Processing in Extreme Conditions using Remote Sensing Data

--![](docs/TBC)--

This project endeavours to engineer a nimble neural network model for real-time classification of satellite imagery under cloud-based edge computing scenarios. Drawing inspiration from the urgent need for rapid and precise data in defence and security realms, this initiative demonstrates the ability to handle high-resolution satellite data with limited computational leverage, particularly emphasising real-world, high-risk applications. This project aims to augment conventional remote sensing methodologies, assuring prompt identification and analysis of crucial features within the imagery, even under the most extreme conditions, such as the Earth's orbit.

## Objective
The core objective is to develop a lightweight, efficient neural network model for real-time satellite image classification on cloud-based edge computing environments.

## Installation
Clone this repository using git:
```$ git clone https://github.com/boemer00/edge-processing-remote-sensing.git```

The primary dataset for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Satellite Image Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification). Additional datasets and resources may be incorporated to enrich the model training phase.

## Project Update
This is project is in development (last updated: 25 Oct 23)
